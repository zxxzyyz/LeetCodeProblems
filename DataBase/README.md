My solution for open problems(free sources) from LeetCode.
### Second Highest Salary
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```
##### Solution
```
SELECT max(Salary) as "SecondHighestSalary"
FROM Employee WHERE Salary < (SELECT max(Salary) FROM Employee)
```
```
SELECT max(Salary) as "SecondHighestSalary"
FROM Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT max(Salary) FROM Employee)
```

### Combine Two Tables
```
Table: Person
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```
Table: Address
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
 

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State
##### Solution
```
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, a.City, a.State
FROM Person as p
LEFT JOIN Address as a
ON p.PersonId = a.PersonId
```

### Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```
##### Solution
```
SELECT e.name as Employee FROM Employee e
WHERE e.Salary > (SELECT m.Salary FROM Employee m WHERE m.Id = e.ManagerId)
```

### Duplicate Emails
Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.
```
+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:
```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```
##### Solution
```
SELECT Email FROM Person GROUP BY Email HAVING COUNT(Email) > 1
```
